# Materials to read before Week 0:

Since we are not going to teach JavaScript in the Node course, be sure that you know the language well.

Here is a list of good materials for refresh your memory about JavaScript. If you find anything that is not familiar - read it & understand it!

* If you are not familiar with functional programming and higher order functions, read this chapter - http://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html
* A very good explanation on the `this` object in JavaScript - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/133973/how-does-this-keyword-work-within-a-javascript-object-literal
