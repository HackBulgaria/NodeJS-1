## Login with GitHub

Using express and [PassportJS](http://passportjs.org/) create a simple web app that lets you login with your GitHub account.

You can use this - https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-github

## Once logged in, link Facebook and / or Twitter accounts

Once you have logged in, there should be a choice for the user to link more social accounts. Because moar!

### Connect to Facebook

Once you are ready, connect your Facebook account to the web app and get the user information!

You can use this - http://passportjs.org/guide/facebook/

### Connect to Twitter

Once you are ready, connect your Twitter account to the web app and get the user information!

You can use this - http://passportjs.org/guide/twitter/

## Problems to solve

Should you have an independent User model and just link facebook and twitter account models to it or use one of the two as a "master" account and just link the second one?

## Making it more beautiful

There are social login bootstrap buttons here - http://lipis.github.io/bootstrap-social/ - you can use them.
