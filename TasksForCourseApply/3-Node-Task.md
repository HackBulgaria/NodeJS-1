##The node task

[https://github.com/asotirov/that-node-task](https://github.com/asotirov/that-node-task) 

This link leads to the code of a node.js application. The application runs an express server, that is used to make simple CRUD requests to a database. Users of the application can create, read, update and delete objects in the database.

Some methods are left unimplemented and your task is to complete them, so the provided tests pass.

Full details are available in the **README.md** of the repository.

Good luck!
